    <h4>The Goal: Product Photography</h4>
    <p>
      We are dedicated to producing
      high quality product photography. The main products we shoot
      include watches and cars. We also feature variety of other products
      related to the fashion and technology industries. Our goal is to 
      capture all things that are beutifully engineered.

    <h4>Our Story: Two Brothers and a Camera</h4>
    <p>
    We are two brothers, Tyler and Kyle, and are based out of Hartford, Connecticut 
    in our parents basement. Both of us are college students studying engineering. Our 
    passion for design and photography inspired our ideas. We wanted to share our passion
    with our friends so TXK (Tyler and Kyle) Productionz was created in April 2020.

    <h4>Sponsorship</h4>
    <p>
    Many of the watches shown are a courtasy of our sponsor who is a private watch collector.
    If you are interested in sending products for us to shoot, feel free to contact us.
